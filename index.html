    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would advise my potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks by giving information about web security threats such as Cross-Sight scripting, SQL injection, and Cross-Sight request forgery. To make sure they know what kind of threats there are in the world wide web I would dig deeper into what can happen on any infrastructure, such as the server and client sides, and the consequences of web security attacks where they can lose private account passwords or even worse, identity and financial fraud. But there are many different web security practices proven to be efficient, such as sanitization of data, network security, continuous deployment/ integration, third-party applications, and secure authentication and authorization. I would recommend one of the different practices for their website to protect their potential users from web security attacks.]</p>
