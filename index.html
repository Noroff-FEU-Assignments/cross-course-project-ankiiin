    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise my potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks by giving information about web security threats such as Cross-Sight scripting, SQL injection, and Cross-Sight request forgery. To make sure they know what kind of threats there are in the world wide web I would dig deeper into what can happen on any infrastructure, such as the server and client sides, and the consequences of web security attacks where they can lose private account passwords, and identity and financial fraud. But many different web security practices are proven to be efficient, such as sanitization of data, network security, continuous deployment/ integration, and third-party applications. I would recommend one of the different practices for their website to protect their potential users from web security attacks. Since everyone is using the world wide web most of their time at work, it is important to include everyone in the business when informing about web attacks. The use of security exercises such as red team vs blue team to check if their sensitive information is safe is one of the best ways to prevent security attacks.</p>
